# About irrigation-sys-simulator

   The sole purpose of this project is to create a simulator of a real embedded system dedicated to plants irrigation. Actually, the
need for creating this simulator came during the development of an Android app responsible for managing different irrigation tasks 
which are executed on embedded device's side(for more information you can check the above mentioned Android app's repository:
https://github.com/ivanbo97/plants-irrigation-app.git).
